## Current Release

Starting with wxPython 4.0 (the first Phoenix release) the wxPython source
archive and, for supported platforms, wxPython binary wheels are available
from the Python Package Index (PyPI). wxPython's project page at PyPI is
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wxPython>.

The source or binary wheels can be downloaded directly from the project
page, or you can use the wonderful [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
tool to do it for you.  Just run something like this from a command-line:

```
pip install -U wxPython
```

If you are on a supported platform with a compatible Python build, then
that command will download the appropriate wheel file from the latest
release, and install it in your Python environment, or active Python
virtual environment for you.

If there is no binary wheel file available for your platform or Python,
then pip will download the source archive and will attempt to build it for
you.

### Building with Pip

wxPython is a very large and complex package, with several dependencies,
and in many cases is not very easy to build. Since pip will be using the
source tarball then all of the source files that are generated by other
tools are included, eliminating much of the build complexity. However there
are still library and tools dependencies that need to be present on the
system while doing the build.  The best place to find out about these
dependencies is the
[README.rst](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/blob/master/README.rst)
file in the source tree. You should familiarize yourself with the whole
file, but pay particular attention to the 
[prerequisites](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/blob/master/README.rst#prerequisites) 
section.


### Extra Files

In addition to the source and binaries available on PyPI there are some
extra files which are part of each release, which are hosted at 
<https://extras.wxPython.org/wxPython4/extras/>. 
The things you will find there are:

* A tarball containing the **wxPython API documentation**, which is the
same content available at <https://docs.wxpython.org>. You can use this
copy of the reference docs for local off-line reading of the API reference
material.  Look for a file named like `wxPython-docs-VERSION.tar.gz`.

* A tarball containing the **wxPython demo** and **samples**. It is highly
encouraged for new wxPython users, and experienced ones too, to download
this file. It is a great learning resource with tons of examples showing
how to use various components of the wxPython library. Look for a file
named like `wxPython-demo-VERSION.tar.gz`.

* Zip files with `*.pdb` files which are Visual Studio debugger information files. 

* Binary wheel files for a few flavors of **Linux**. 


### Yes, we have Linux Wheels. Sort of.

Because of the differences between distributions (mainly different versions
of the core libraries installed by default, but also platform architecture
and etc.) it is not possible to host binary wheel files for Linux on PyPI
unless they can be made to work within the constraints of 
[PEP 513](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/) Unfortunately, attempts to
pound the wxPython peg into the `manylinux1` hole have not been very
successful. Maybe `manylinux2` will be a better fit. In the meantime, if you
have a Linux similar enough to those used to build the wheels located under the 
[wxPython Extras linux](https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/) 
folder, then you can use them and not need to build the wheels yourself.

Since there are various options for distro and wx port (GTK2 or GTK3) then
the files can not all be located in the same folder for easy access by pip.
This simply just means that you'll need to drill down a little further to
find the URL to give to pip.  For example, to get the GTK3 wxPython builds
for Ubuntu 16.04 (and 16.10, LinuxMint 18, and probably others) you can use
a pip command like this:

```
pip install -U \
    -f https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/ubuntu-16.04 \
    wxPython
```

Of course you can always download the wheel file yourself and then use pip
to install your local copy of the file.



## The Bleeding Edge

If you're the daredevil type and prefer to work with the absolutely newest
version of wxPython, we've got a couple options for you.


### Snapshot Builds

Each day that there are commits to wxPython Phoenix's master branch, the
[buildbot](http://buildbot.wxpython.org/) will attempt to do a "daily
build". If successful then the resulting wheels, docs, and source archives
will be uploaded to the 
[snapshots folder](https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/snapshot-builds/). 
Although these are not technically official releases, and may have new 
undiscovered and unsolved bugs, more than a few people use them 
successfully in their own projects.


### GitHub

wxPython's GitHub project is at <https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix>. If
you want to tinker with the code (preferably in order to submit a
[PR](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pulls)) then this option is what
you are looking for. Fork and clone a copy of the git repository for
yourself and start tweaking away under the hood.

Since the generated files are not committed to git you will need to go
through several more steps to generate and build the code, but they are all
handled by the
[`build.py`](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/blob/master/build.py)
script and there is a overview of the process and needed steps in the
[README](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/blob/master/README.rst). If
you get stuck then you can ask about it on 
[wxPython-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wxpython-dev).



## Old Releases

The wxPython releases prior to 4.0 (a.k.a "Classic" wxPython) will remain
available at
[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/).
That includes source, documentation, the demo, and various binary
installers for Windows and Mac systems.
