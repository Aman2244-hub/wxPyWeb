[wxPython](http://wxPython.org/) is a **GUI toolkit** for the
[Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language. It allows Python
programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional
graphical user interface, simply and easily. It is implemented as a
Python extension module (native code) that wraps the popular
[wxWidgets](http://wxwidgets.org/) cross platform GUI library, which is
written in C++.

Like Python and wxWidgets, wxPython is **Open Source** which means that
it is free for anyone to use and the source code is available for anyone
to look at and modify. And anyone can contribute fixes or enhancements
to the project.

wxPython is a **cross-platform** toolkit. This means that the same
program will run on multiple platforms without modification. Currently
supported platforms are 32-bit Microsoft Windows, most Unix or unix-like
systems, and Macintosh OS X.

Since the language is Python, wxPython programs are **simple, easy** to
write and easy to understand.
