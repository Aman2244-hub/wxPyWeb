`GNUmed <http://wiki.gnumed.de/bin/view/Gnumed>`_ is a Free/Libre
electronic medical record (EMR) for Unix-like systems (BSD, Linux, and UNIX
systems), Microsoft Windows, macOS and other platforms. GNUmed aims to
provide medical software that respects the privacy of patients and that is
based on open standards.

GNUmed is based on third party projects such as free software/open source
DBMS PostgreSQL and is written mostly in Python. It is supported by a
graphical user interface (GUI) based on wxPython.
