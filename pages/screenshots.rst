`GNUmed <http://wiki.gnumed.de/bin/view/Gnumed>`_ is a Free/Libre
electronic medical record (EMR) for Unix-like systems (BSD, Linux, and UNIX
systems), Microsoft Windows, macOS and other platforms. GNUmed aims to
provide medical software that respects the privacy of patients and that is
based on open standards.

GNUmed is based on third party projects such as free software/open source
DBMS PostgreSQL and is written mostly in Python. It is supported by a
graphical user interface (GUI) based on wxPython.

`RIDE <https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE>`_ is is a test data 
editor for `Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org/>`_ test data. 
Navigate through your Test Suites folders, and run them
filtering by Tags. Edit Test Cases in the Cell Editor with context help and
code highlighting, or use the Text Editor for space formatted files. Select
the language binding to run Robot Framework, like Jython or Python, and
then open on your browser the Log or Report files with a click. It runs on
Linux, Mac and Windows.

    .. thumbnail:: /screenshots/outwiker_2.0.0_05_en.png


`OutWiker <http://jenyay.net/Outwiker/English>`_ is designed to store notes in a tree. Such programs are called "outliner", personal wiki, or tree-like editors. OutWiker's main difference from the other similar programs is keeping the tree of notes in the form of directories on disk, and encouraging changing the base by external sources and programs.

Also any number of files can be attached to the page. OutWiker can contain pages of different types, currently supports three types of pages: plain text, HTML pages and wiki pages, but the number of types of pages will increase in future.
